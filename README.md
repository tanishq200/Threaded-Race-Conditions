# Python Solution for Race Condition Detection and Resolution

## Overview

This project presents a Python-based solution to detect and resolve race conditions within multi-threaded applications. By emphasizing robust concurrency management, the implementation enhances system reliability and prevents common synchronization issues.

## Features

- **Concurrency Management**: Utilizes threading to simulate concurrent operations that may lead to race conditions.
- **Race Condition Detection**: Implements detection mechanisms to identify potential race conditions in real-time.
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Provides strategies for resolving race conditions dynamically, ensuring system stability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Socket module (standard library)

## Usage

To run the Python script to simulate and resolve race conditions, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**
   ```bash
   python3 race_condition_resolver.py
   ```

This script will start multiple threads performing deposit, withdrawal, and flag purchase operations to demonstrate the occurrence and resolution of race conditions.

## Detailed Function Descriptions

- **deposit()**: This function continually attempts to deposit funds into an account via a server, demonstrating potential concurrency issues in deposit operations.
- **withdraw()**: Similar to the deposit function, this continuously attempts to withdraw funds, which can conflict with deposit operations and lead to race conditions.
- **purchase_flag()**: This function tries to purchase a flag after deposits and withdrawals, showing how multiple operations can affect critical transaction outcomes.

## Threads and Synchronization

Each function (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `purchase_flag`) is run in its own thread, simulating a real-world scenario where different system components operate concurrently. Proper synchronization techniques are crucial to prevent data inconsistency and ensure system reliability.

## Conclusions

The implemented solution effectively detects and resolves race conditions, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of multi-threaded applications. It serves as a practical demonstration of implementing concurrency management techniques in Python.
